## Overview

### Challenge

Your challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

**Bonus**: We provide the data for the results in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to add the results and total score dynamically if you choose.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- JavaScript (for the **[bonus](#challenge)**)

### What I learned

I learned how to create gradient background using TailwindCSS. I also found out about [`aspect-ratio`](https://www.w3schools.com/Cssref/css_pr_aspect-ratio.php) property in CSS and [`Math.trunc()`](https://www.w3schools.com/Jsref/jsref_trunc.asp) function in JavaScript that I used to get the integer part of a number.
