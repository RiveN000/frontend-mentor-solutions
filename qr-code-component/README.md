## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (mainly flexbox, paddings, margins)

### What I learned

I learned how to deconstruct a design into smaller parts and then join them together to form the whole design. I also realized that you can use flexbox to center an element vertically and horizontally. My first thought would be to use `position: absolute`.

```html
<!-- Container to center the card -->
<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-screen">
  <!-- Card -->
</div>
```
